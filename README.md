PROJECT TITLE-SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR MARKETING

Problemn Definition: The problem is to perfom centiment analyse on customer feedback to gain insights into competitor products. By understanding customer sentiments, companies cen Identity strengths and weaknesses in competing products, thereby improving their own offerings. This project requires utilizing various NLP methods to extract valuable insights from customer feedback

Data Collection

1. Data Sources: Collect customer feedback data from nous sources, such as

product review websites (Amazon Yep), social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook) surveys, or even email corespondence

2. Data Quantity: Ensure you have a sufficiently large dataset to make meaningful

analyses. The more data you have the more robust your insights can be 3. Deta Quality. Pay alertion to date quality. Remove duplicates, inelevent information, or spam. Consider using wch scraping tools or APIs to automate data

collection

Date Preprocessing

1. Text Cleaning Clean and preprocess the text data by moving special characters,

HTML tags, punctuation, and comenting text to lowercase

2. Tokenization: Split text into words or tokens. This is essential for moet NLP teska 3. Stopword Removal Eliminate common stopwords (eg, the and that dont carry much sentiment information

4. Lemmatization or Stemming Reduce words to their base or not form to sum consistency in word representation.

5. Handling Imbalanced Data: Check if you have imbalanced classes (eg, many

undersampling.

more positive reviews than negative) Consider techniques like oversampling or

Sentiment Analysts Technique:

1. Leased (se sentiment lexicons or dictionaries to assign sentiment scores

to words and calculate the overall sentiment of each review or comment 2. Machine Learning Models: Train supervised machine leaming models (eg, SVM, Kaive Bayes, Random Forst) on labeled sentiment data to classify revices as

postive, negative, or neutral

Q :

3. Deep Learning Models Explore deep leaming models like LSTM, CNN or transformerbased models (BERT, GPT) for sentiment classification, especially if you

have a large dataset

4. Aspect-Based Analyse: Consider analyzing sentiments regarding specific product

asports, design, performance) in addition to overall sentiment

Visualization

1. Word Clouds: Create word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in positive and negative revis

2. Sentiment Distribution. Plot histograms or pie charts to visuales the distribution of centiments in the dataset 3. Time Series Analysle. If applicable, analyze sentiment trends over time to identity

4. Bar Charts: Use bar charts to compare sentiment scores across diffemst competitor products or categories

1. Strengths and Weaknesses identify the strengths and weaknesses of each competitor product based on sentiment analysis results. Ave there common them in position and negative feedback?

2. Feature Importance if using machine learning models, analyze feature importanca to understand which words or features contribute most to centiment 5. Competitor Benchmarking Benchmark the sentiment of competitor products

against each other to see which amos they excel or fall short!

4. Customer Preferences Understand customer profemmes by axamining which product features or aspects receive the most positive or negative feedback.
